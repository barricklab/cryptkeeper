# Cryptkeeper Note:
The Promoter Calculator is derived from the Salis Lab in the below paper. This package is not immediately available on PIP or Bioconda, so we ship it with Cryptkeeper. See the notes below. The package has been slightly modified to allow for easier use through the command line or as a python module.

Abstract:
Transcription rates are regulated by the interactions between RNA polymerase, sigma factor, and promoter DNA sequences in bacteria. However, it remains unclear how non-canonical sequence motifs collectively control transcription rates. Here, we combined massively parallel assays, biophysics, and machine learning to develop a 346-parameter model that predicts site-specific transcription initiation rates for any σ70 promoter sequence, validated across 17396 bacterial promoters with diverse sequences. We applied the model to predict genetic context effects, design σ70 promoters with desired transcription rates, and identify undesired promoters inside engineered genetic systems. The model provides a biophysical basis for understanding gene regulation in natural genetic systems and precise transcriptional control for engineering synthetic genetic systems.
